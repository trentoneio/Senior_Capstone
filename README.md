# Smart Home Mailbox
For my senior project, myself as well as two classmates are developing a smart mailbox system. To open the mailbox, a user will be required to provide biometric authentication via a fingerprint scan as well as a RFID scan.

I myself am responsible for all of the code in this project. My partners are responsible for making sure all of the hardware works together, as well as building their own implementations of an RFID transceiver and tags, and a power supply.
